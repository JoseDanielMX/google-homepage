This is a mini-project from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) where I'm going to deconstruct an exisiting web page and rebuild it.

Some skills I should learn by doing this:

1. Move divs around on the page
2. Stick divs
3. Identify the background color of the webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image
5. Center elements horizontally
6. Identify three ways for including CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS
8. Build a basic form
